                <h3>Mission</h3>

                <p>To support young athletes living in Chicago's northside neighborhoods, who have an interest in
                    learning
                    and playing soccer, with opportunities to learn and practice skills related to the game of soccer,
                    especially those skills related to team cooperation and good sportsmanship.
                </p>

                <h3>Vision</h3>

                <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong, well-rounded, and mindful athletes
                    through
                    the building of character, self-discipline, and leadership.</p>

                <h3>General Info</h3>

                <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in Chicago's
                    northside neighborhood an environment to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be
                    between the ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is run by a small,
                    full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and former league members.</p>
